<h2>Aim of this game</h2>

<p>You are an adventurer and you will explore different worlds during your journey. You need to avoid the different obstacles on your way(cactus or crystals) and you should collect the different gems to get a maximum number of points. Each gem has a different value. If you hit an obstacle, you will lose points, depending on the duration the character is in contact with the obstacle.
You will lose points faster if you hit a crystal as compared to a cactus. Also be careful on the winter level, the ground is more slippery.

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>For this game, I found a basic tutorial for platforms games online(http://www.somethinghitme.com/2013/01/09/creating-a-canvas-platformer-tutorial-part-one/). This tutorial explained how to create a platform game where a player can jump on other platforms, using collision detection. I have stated in the comments which part of the tutorial I have taken.</p>

<p>I also used w3schools and stackoverflow as a help.</p>
