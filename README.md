# The_little_adventurer
Platform game implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This game was made for the coursework of the module 'Programming for the web'. 

It is a platform game with 3 different levels. The player has to jump on different platforms to move to the next level. He/She should collect as many jems as possible in order to increase their score. However, they must avoid obstacles found on each level, as these will take away their accumulated points.
